        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>In recent years, the bee population has been at a sharp decline. Scientists have named the phenomenon "colony collapse disorder" (CCD). Dramatic events have occurred, ridding the world of its bees: there has been a loss of 30% from beekeepers in the past 10 years, in both the United States and Europe. In addition, 44 percent of beehives collapsed April 2015-16, which is three times the acceptable amount of beehives gone. This phenomenon is of serious concern to many scientists, who fear a tragic ending to this dramatic event.</p>

      <div id="why">
        <h2>Why is it happening?</h2>
        <p>Scientists have worked hard and long to solve the mystery of why the bee homicide is happening, but they have come up with no completely accepted explanation. However, there is no shortage of plausible theories. Some of the most popular theories scientists have some up with consist of global warming and a disease named varroosis.</p>
        <p>Let’s first talk about global warming. Theorists say that the warming of the earth has caused bees to lose 200 miles off of their southern native land. The environment has become too hot to host either bees or the bee food.</p>
        <p>Another possible idea is varroosis, a disease caused by parasitic varroa mites. Varroa mites, if left untreated, will suck the blood of developing and adult bees, shortening their lifespans. If varroa mites come in contact with developing honeybees they can end up being deformed with missing wings, legs, and many other clinical deformities. These varroa mites can also harbor pathogens which can make bees sickly and weak.</p>
        <p>In addition to global warming and varroa mites, new insecticides like neonicotinoids currently promoted by insecticide companies are lethal to bees. These insecticides also have little advantage over past insecticides. There are many factors that could be causing the dying of the bees, and reversing these factors is of the utmost importance.</p>

      <div id="importance">
        <h2>Why should we stop it?</h2>
        <p>As you may not know, bees provide for most  of the world’s crop. Without these creatures, a large amount of the world might as well stop eating things like nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Look at it in this perspective: one out of every three bites of food you take is pollinated by bees. All of your favorite foods will be gone without the help of bees. All of them will be much harder to find with the extinction of bees.</p>
        <p>There are also serious economic issues with bees gone. In the U.S. alone, domesticated bee hives are worth up to two million dollars and pollinate 15 billion dollars worth of crop; around the world, they are worth up to 2 billion dollars. The extinction of bees would have unimaginable consequences.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="how">
        <h2>How do we stop it?</h2>
        <p>Since the bee genocide is mostly caused by humans we can still try to do something about this serious problem. Humans could cut down on the use of lethal pesticides while growing crop. While also trying to keep crop safe from other insects humans are using pesticide to kill off mosquitoes that are contaminated by Zika, a serious disease that causes microcephaly. The use of pesticide kills off hundreds of bees trying to pollinate crop. After a bee pollinates a crop that had poisoned with pesticide; it will head back to the hive with the contaminated food which will further more damage the all the bees that eat the food. Another way humans could stop the killing of bees is by stopping the act of deforestation. Deforestation is cutting down of trees, trees that have the potential to contain bee hives.  Bees have a huge role in the community of agriculture, without them we would be lost.</p>
